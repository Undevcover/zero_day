this is a project to install virtual machine on my computer. i dont have a computer, so im using my phone. i downloaded UserLand and i use Ubuntu on it. its kinda similar to having a virtual machine as well. and i hate typing with these keyboards.no autocorrect,autosoacing or auto capitalize. not efficient for long typing
